Minecraft Autoclicker
Made By SuperBoxes

Ideal delay is: 0.03 (0.02 if you're risky)

This is just a simple autoclicker made by SuperBoxes.
Features:
1. AutoClicker (left and right mouse buttons)
2. Delay (cps)
3. Randomization

This probably wont get you banned on a cps 10-15. Used it on my main, havent got banned yet, Lunar and Hypixel, remember, use at your own risk!. Enjoy!


Delay to cps:
0.05 = 10 cps
0.04 = 12 cps
0.03 = 13 cps
0.02 = 15-16 cps
0.01 = 19 cps
0 = 22-23 cps
